This is a simple and interactive web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that listens for keyboard events and displays real-time information about the key you press. 
It shows both the character of the key and its corresponding ASCII (keyCode) value. This tool is perfect for testing keyboard input, understanding how JavaScript key events work, or just having fun exploring which codes are assigned to different keys on your keyboard. 
Itâ€™s especially useful for beginners learning about event handling or for developers building custom keyboard controls.
